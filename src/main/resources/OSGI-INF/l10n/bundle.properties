# Web Console strings for reference all strings here are commented.
# This file may be used to produce a translation of the strings
#
# Note that properties files are ISO-8859-1 encoded. To provide translations
# for languages requiring different character encodings, you may use the
# native2ascii Maven Plugin from http://mojo.codehaus.org/native2ascii-maven-plugin/
# to translate the natively encoded files to ISO-8859-1 during bundle build
#
# Translations requiring non-ISO-8859-1 encoding are placed in the
# src/main/native2ascii/OSGI-INF/l10n folder and are converted using said
# plugin while building the bundle
